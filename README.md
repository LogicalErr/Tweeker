## General Info
Tweeker represents a web platform reminiscent of X, where I meticulously implemented user-friendly features. These include user registration, login/logout functionalities, tweet and retweet capabilities, as well as a variety of user profile features. The backend logic is fortified by Django, providing a solid foundation, while React ensures a dynamic and engaging frontend experience. User authentication is seamlessly executed through JWT for enhanced security. The platform is further optimized with the integration of MySQL and Redis Docker images â€“ MySQL serves as the primary data storage solution, while Redis contributes to an efficient and responsive caching system. ~For a quick demonstration, you can visit the [DEMO](https://tweeker-fm8dmq290-amirnourani.vercel.app/), although it is recommended to run it locally until any issues are resolved.~
