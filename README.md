## General Info
Tweeker is a web-based platform resembling Twitter utilizing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Django. In this project I constructed user-friendly functionalities such as user registration login/logout, tweet and retweet functionality, and user profile features. you can see [DEMO](https://tweeker-fm8dmq290-amirnourani.vercel.app/) but because of some issues I suggest you to run it in your local machine until i fix it. 


## Setup
notice that first you need to install the requirement packages. open your terminal and write below commands:
```
$ cd Tweeker/
$ pip install -r requirements.txt 
```
Then run the project in your local machine using: 
```
$ python3 manage.py runserver
or
$ ./manage.py runserver
```

Feel free to develop and request pulls to this, any time :) 

Best regards.
